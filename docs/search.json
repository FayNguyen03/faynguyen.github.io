Therefore, South Dakota is the state with the lowest percentage of healed wounds (&lt;87%) while Rhode Island is the highest (&gt;93%). The states in the Northeastern and South East regions tend to have higher percentage of healing than the other regions of the country. This plot can provide valuable insights into the healthcare quality of each state. However, we need to carefully consider various factors beyond the raw averages to accurately assess and compare healthcare quality between states since each state has different population demographics as well as patients’ access to healthcare services and how frequently individuals utilize these services can impact healing rates. Therefore, while state averages for wound healing after operations provide an important snapshot of healthcare outcomes of each state, they should be interpreted within the broader context of demographic, socioeconomic, policy, and healthcare system factors."
